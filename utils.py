"""
Utility decorators for HIT137 Assignment 3.

Why this file?
- The brief asks to demonstrate *multiple decorators*.  We provide two simple,
  dependencyâ€‘free decorators you can stack on functions/methods to satisfy that.
- Used by models.py to log calls and measure inference time.

Usage:
    from utils import logger, timed

    @logger
    @timed
    def run(...):
        ...

Both decorators are intentionally minimal and safe for a teaching context.
